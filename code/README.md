# Project Happy Thoughts

How to use the useEffect hook in React to perform actions when components mount, unmount, or when state changes.

# problem 
1. Lots of Eslint errors which could solve it just by googling and find answers in StackOverflow
2. Got problem for adding span to my buttons and I still need to find out the answer
3.  importing momemnt and {moment(thought.createdAt).fromNow()} helped to display the time 
4. used const options in ThoughtsApp as the exampel of the week but I need to undrestand why options used in fetch API too!!
